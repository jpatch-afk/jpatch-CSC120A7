Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

For the House file: moveOut() and moveIn() to moveAround() and hasADiningRoom() and nResidents() to checkContents()
For the Cafe file: created a specialty drink method (specialty()) and enter() and exit() to move()
For the Library file: checkOut() and returnBook() to bookMovement() and addTitle() and removeTitle() to editCollection() 

Adding the new methods to the House, Cafe, and Library files was not difficult. Compared to some of the other things I did for this assignment, it was easy to override them to cater to the specific parameters of the 'building' that the user is currently in. Overloading the methods also worked, but it was a bit of a challenge to pick which methods to merge into a single method. I chose methods that either had the same parameters or no parameters to prevent weird input for something that doesn't need it. It was similar code, but with extra if statements. What didn't work was some weird errors that didn't bother me in A6, but pop up here. I plan to look back and try again. The advice I would give in the future would be to not make things more complicated than they need to be and overload methods that you know won't be difficult to combine.
